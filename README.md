# Multithreaded_proxy_server-client

**INTRODUCTION:**
A multithreaded server is any server that has more than one thread.
Because a transport requires its own thread, multithreaded servers also
have multiple transports. The number of thread-transport pairs that a
server contains defines the number of requests that the server can
handle in parallel.

**WHAT IS SOCKET PROGRAMMING?**
Socket Programming is a method to connect two nodes over a network
to establish a means of communication between those two nodes. A
node represents a computer or a physical device with an internet
connection. A socket is the endpoint used for connecting to a node.
